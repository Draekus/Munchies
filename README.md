Welcome to Munchies Metropolis! This app is built on top of the Zomato API. To enable full functionality, location services are required to be enabled. The UI is mobile responsive and built with the CSS Grid system.

When the page loads, you are greeting with a welcome modal that gives the user the option to create an account, sign in, or proceed as a guest. Signing in enables the ability to favorite and un favorite restaurants for easy access to details. Favorites will appear in the sidebar area.

To search, type a keyword into the text input. There are additional optional search filters to sort results by Rating, Price, or Distance from your current location. If the text input is left blank, a general search based on your coordinates is performed.

The API results are displayed in a grid of detail cards, each of which have a button to display additional details about the restaurant, and a button to add the restaurant to the user's favorites. Additionally, inside the retaurant details modal, an embedded google map is placed so the user can more clearly see where the establishment is.
